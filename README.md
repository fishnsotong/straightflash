INTUition 2016 with Victoria School

We intend to create an office delivery system whereby small objects can be
delivered by wheeled robots. The need for this comes from appreciating that
productivity and focus are often scarce, and leaving your workspace to run an
errand or to pass a printout to a coworker can cause you to leave "the zone".

As such, this web-app endeavors to incorporate a physical delivery system into
your workflow, where you can hail a delivery robot from a website, and would
trigger a robot to be sent to your workspace.

## Further improvements
* Some form of autonomy in the robot
* Some form of automation between web-app and the robot fleet
* The eventual development of such a system that can be easily monetized.

at iNTUition in 2016.

We are a team of novice and new coders from Victoria School's class of 2016,
consisting of Ivan, Jonathan, Jordan and Wayne.
